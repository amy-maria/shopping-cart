# React + TypeScript + Vite

This React+ TypeScript project is a very basic shopping cart application that allows the user to add, remove and update the quantity of an item(s) in the shopping cart. The place order function mimics the place order function however no customer data is collected nor sent to a point of sale app.

This tutorial idea and project is from Dave Gray.
